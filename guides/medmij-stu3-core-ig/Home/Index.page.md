This is the implementation guide for MedMij STU3 Core.

Please note that this guide is currently in its Proof of Concept (PoC) phase. It serves as an initial version to help you get started and provide insights into the key steps of implementation. As we progress through the PoC phase, we are actively gathering feedback, identifying areas for improvement, and documenting lessons learned.

A new and enhanced version of this guide will be released after the alpha (PoC) phase is complete. The updated version will include additional insights, refinements, and comprehensive details based on everything we encountered during this phase.

For questions or feedback on the IG, please reach out to MedMij via [info@medmij.nl](mailto:info@medmij.nl).
